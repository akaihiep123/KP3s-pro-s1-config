Personal setting for KP5L and Orca settings
Settings:
  1.ABL 3dtouch
  2.Bed 310x310
  3.BTT LIS2DW input shaping
  4.Screw adjust
  5. Macro speed test. kinda overrate since the orca default slicer did show that Max accel is 3000

  Planning:
  Implemennt the start/end gcode from slicer to macro DONE

  NOTE: You can implement these settings to KP3s Pro S1 since they have same board, same hotend, same extruder. Change your XYZ max back to 200mm.
  You still need to tune input shaping, pid hotend and bed, etc ... since i believe each printer have their own different set.
